In Objective-C, a rare but impactful error arises when dealing with KVO (Key-Value Observing) and memory management.  Specifically, it occurs when an observer is not removed properly before the observed object is deallocated. This can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior because the observer attempts to access memory that no longer exists.  The crash might not appear immediately; it can manifest much later, making it difficult to track down.  This is particularly challenging in complex applications where many objects observe each other.
