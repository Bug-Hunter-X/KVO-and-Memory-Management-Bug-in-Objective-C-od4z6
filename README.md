# Objective-C KVO Memory Management Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) in Objective-C and its solution.  The problem arises from improper removal of observers before the observed object is deallocated. This can lead to crashes or unpredictable behavior due to attempts to access freed memory. 

## Bug Description
The `KVODeallocBug.m` file contains code illustrating the issue. An object observes another object's property. If the observed object is deallocated without removing the observer, accessing the property later causes a crash.

## Solution
The `KVODeallocFix.m` file shows how to solve this problem by ensuring the observer is always removed using the `removeObserver:forKeyPath:` method before the observed object is deallocated. This is typically done in the `dealloc` method of the observer class.

## How to reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run `KVODeallocBug.m` to see the crash.
3. Compile and run `KVODeallocFix.m` to see the corrected behavior.

## Conclusion
Careful memory management is crucial when using KVO in Objective-C. Always remember to remove observers in the appropriate lifecycle methods to avoid unpredictable errors and crashes.
